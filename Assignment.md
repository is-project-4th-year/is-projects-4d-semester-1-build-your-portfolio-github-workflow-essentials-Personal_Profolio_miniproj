## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).
For each one, mention:

---

**1. Concept: Git Commands (Add, Commit, Push)**

- **Expectation**: I assumed I’d just memorize a few basic commands and be done with it—maybe use them once in a while when uploading a project.

- **Reality**: Turns out, Git commands are *core tools* I need constantly. Even a small mistake like forgetting to stage before committing can mess things up.

- **Impact**: I got comfortable using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` daily while working on my profile site, which made tracking changes and syncing my code to GitHub super smooth.

---

**2. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

- **Expectation**: I thought Git would magically handle merges and I wouldn’t need to worry about conflicts.

- **Reality**: I found out that merge conflicts happen when multiple people (or branches) change the same part of a file. Git needs *you* to decide which changes to keep.

- **Impact**: I faced a real conflict while editing an HTML file and learned how to manually resolve it. Now, I’m more confident dealing with collaborative code without fear of breaking things.

---

**3. Concept: Git Rebase**

- **Expectation**: I had no clue what rebase was—just another scary Git word I thought only experts used.

- **Reality**: I learned that `git rebase` helps keep a cleaner commit history by replaying my changes on top of another branch. It’s like “re-writing history” to make the timeline look smoother.

- **Impact**: I used rebase to clean up a messy branch before merging it into the main branch of my portfolio project, which made the project history easier to understand.

---

**4. Concept: Writing Clear Commit Messages**

- **Expectation**: I thought commit messages could be random or something like “stuff” or “fix 1”.

- **Reality**: I learned that a good commit message helps others (and future me) understand what changed and why. It avoids confusion and improves collaboration.

- **Impact**: I started writing clear, specific messages like `Add profile image section for Arthur` instead of vague ones. This made my contribution logs readable and professional.

---

**5. Concept: Repositories and Cloning**

- **Expectation**: I thought "repo" just meant an online folder, and cloning was just downloading stuff.

- **Reality**: A repository is a full Git project with tracked history. Cloning gives you a working copy *with Git tracking intact*, not just a zip file.

- **Impact**: I was able to clone our team’s shared repo and push my contributions without messing up the main structure. Helped me collaborate better during the team profile project.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

### A. Milestones and Issues

This screenshot shows a milestone I created to track progress on the portfolio site. The linked issues represent different parts of the project like layout setup, About Me section, and contact form.
- Screenshot showing your milestone(s) and the issues linked to it.

### B. Project Board

- Here is my GitHub project board. I used columns like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done” to visually manage the status of each task in the portfolio project.

### C. Branching

- Screenshot showing your branch list with meaningful naming.

### D. Pull Requests

- Screenshot of a pull request that’s either open or merged and linked to a related issue.

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution

- Screenshot of a resolved merge conflict (in a pull request, commit history, or your local terminal/GitHub Desktop).
