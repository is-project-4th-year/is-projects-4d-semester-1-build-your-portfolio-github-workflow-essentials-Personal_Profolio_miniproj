                <div class="label">1. Concept: Commit Messages</div>
                <div><strong>  Expectation ðŸ‘€</strong>: I thought any short message would work for commits, as long as I could remember what I did.</div>
                <div><strong>  Reality ðŸ˜…</strong>: Structured commit messages made my project history much clearer and easier to follow, especially when looking back at changes.</div>
                <div><strong>  Impact ðŸ’¡</strong>: I started using clear, conventional commit messages, which helped me and others understand the purpose of each change at a glance.</div>

            <div class="learning-item">
                <div class="label">2. Concept: Pull Requests</div>
                <div><strong>  Expectation ðŸ‘€</strong>: I assumed pull requests were only for teams and not useful for solo projects.</div>
                <div><strong>  Reality ðŸ˜…</strong>: Using pull requests helped me review my own code before merging and kept my main branch stable.</div>
                <div><strong>  Impact ðŸ’¡</strong>: I used pull requests to organize my workflow and document the purpose of each feature or fix before merging.</div>

            <div class="learning-item">
                <div class="label">3. Concept: Project Boards</div>
                <div><strong>  Expectation ðŸ‘€</strong>: I thought project boards were overkill for a small portfolio and would just add extra work.</div>
                <div><strong>  Reality ðŸ˜…</strong>: The project board helped me visualize my progress and stay organized, even with a small set of tasks.</div>
                <div><strong>  Impact ðŸ’¡</strong>: I tracked my issues and milestones on the board, which kept me motivated and focused on completing each step.</div>

            <div class="learning-item">
                <div class="label">4. Concept: Merge Conflicts</div>
                <div><strong>  Expectation ðŸ‘€</strong>: I thought merge conflicts would be rare and easy to fix if they happened.</div>
                <div><strong>  Reality ðŸ˜…</strong>: I encountered a merge conflict while working on two features at once, and it took some effort to resolve without losing changes.</div>
                <div><strong>  Impact ðŸ’¡</strong>: I learned to read conflict markers and resolve issues carefully, which gave me more confidence in handling future conflicts.</div>
